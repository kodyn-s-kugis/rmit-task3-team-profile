									<p>Hi, I’m <strong>Chris</strong> (s3851483). I’m very excited to be a part of Wi-Fives. I was born and I’m based in Brisbane and spent most of my time growing up here apart from a brief stint in Melbourne for primary school. I started a Bachelor of Engineering in 2014 and dropped out fairly quickly as I realized it wasn’t what I wanted to pursue as a career. Since then I have been working mainly in call centres, such as Compare the Market and Australia Post, doing a combination of sales and customer service. I have limited experience in IT thus far, apart from simple skills acquired from my prior roles, and building and playing with computers throughout high school. Experimenting with computers, and various software has been a major motivator in opening up my interest into IT. I got married last year in May and I'm excited to be celebrating my first anniversary soon. My hobbies include binging Netflix, computer games and board games; Splendor is one of my favourites. I also enjoy going for nature walks, the picture below was from a vist to Ellenborough Falls. </p>

									<p>I'm <strong>Raymond</strong> (s3853718).I was born and raised in Australia, with my family coming from a Chinese background. I have extended family who live in China and Hong Kong, that I occasionally visit and stay with during vacation periods.  I come primarily from a science background, working in labs doing genetic sequencing and testing. Work that I've done that you might encounter  is a maize product which I worked with, looking to improve yield in unfavourable conditions. While I enjoyed my brief time in this industry, for personal reasons I decided a career change would be for the best and am looking into the IT sector. I've always been curious how things work and as the number of programs/services grows my desire to learn how to create and manipulate them does as well. I have no formal IT experience with my knowledge coming from self-experimentation.  I hope working with Wi-Fives can provide valuable insight and experience in working on an IT project. Apart from IT related projects, during my spare time I like to spend time in the backyard, where over the last few years I have been working on cultivating a garden. I like mostly to keep producing plants: lemons, apricots, mandarin oranges, kaffir, melons and tomatoes are all things I’ve managed to grow.</p>

									<p>Hi, I'm <strong>Matthew</strong> (s3858024). I was born and raised in Brisbane, Australia with a small amount living in South Australia. I'm currently engaged and hoping for our wedding in October 2020. I currently work at the Ronald McDonald House in a supportive role called "Family Experience". I have a passion for helping people and been involved with many volunteering roles throughout my life helping the community. Before my current job, I worked in a Data Centre administration role. This has given me my passion for IT and wanting to learn more about the tech world. I believe the future is IT and we must all adapt for what is coming. I'm looking forward to exploring emerging IT field ideas with my peers in our team Wi-Fives. It's great we can all come together and make something great and share a common passion.</p>

									<p>Hello, I’m <strong>Mitchell</strong> (s3856807), I’m 20 years old and I was born and raised in Australia. My family consists of 2 parents and a younger brother. My background consists of Australian and British heritage as my mum was born in Australia and my Dad was born in England. My IT interest would come from my fascination for computers when I was at a young age. From that I developed a love for both computers and games, Where I would spend most of my time playing them.  I have always wanted to get into the IT industry as I have never been the most physical person and IT is just interesting and is something I would want to do for a living. In terms of hobbies, they mainly include: Gaming and Photography. In terms of IT experience unless you count fixing friends' computers or studying it during my time in school. Then I have some. If not, then I have none.</p>

								<p>Evaluation of people's attributes on how they approach learning, working and receiving feedback ties back into many of the tests that have been done.

						<p>Across the board, team members have chosen positions all relating to the IT industry. More specifically, these jobs correlating to each other by use of programming or various interactions with industry-standard IT software.</p>
						<p>Placing our first focus on Chris, Raymond and Kodyn where their jobs have a lot of similarity in terms of skill-set, but also includes some differences. Chris' ideal occupation is to be an Android Programmer, which involves the development of software and understanding. of programming languages. Similarly to this, Raymond wanting to be a Games Developer and Kodyn looking to be a Senior Front-end Engineer involved the same skill-set. Cohesive teamwork and collaboration in groups are essential for these occupations as they target multi-faceted projects which for example, in Raymond's case is looking at working with game designers and artists to create mobile gaming applications effectively.</p>
						<p>Leading into Matthew and Mitchell's ideal jobs, share some similarities as well in regards to security in particular. Furthermore, these two positions involve maintaining the integrity of systems, whether it be specific to a database/s in Matthew's case or many potential incident points on a system in Mitchell's case.</p>
						<p>Kodyn's ideal occupation has some stark contrasts to all group members chosen positions. Choosing an area of seniority involves a lot more responsibility and more considerable skill-set across many different systems; this could include skills that may involve the management of a team, which may not be present in a more entry-level position.</p>
						<p>Chris and Raymond do have many similarities, but as we can see in Chris' case that his ideal position is explicitly tailored to the Android platform tailoring his focus of what he needs to learn as a skill-set; contrasting with Raymond where he will require a much broader range of programming skills with his scope ranging from various platforms as well as languages.</p>
						<p>If we take a broad approach in comparison of all team members, we can see that Kodyn, Chris and Raymond have a broad scope of skill-sets and involvement with various systems and software; however, with Matthew and Mitchell, we can see more specific tailoring of required skills in their roles from security to database administration.</p>
						<p>We see a majority of our team leaning towards substantial programming roles, but have more specialised occupations as well.</p>
