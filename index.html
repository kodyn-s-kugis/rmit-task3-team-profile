									<p>Hi, I’m <strong>Chris</strong> (s3851483). I’m very excited to be a part of Wi-Fives. I was born and I’m based in Brisbane and spent most of my time growing up here apart from a brief stint in Melbourne for primary school. I started a Bachelor of Engineering in 2014 and dropped out fairly quickly as I realized it wasn’t what I wanted to pursue as a career. Since then I have been working mainly in call centres, such as Compare the Market and Australia Post, doing a combination of sales and customer service. I have limited experience in IT thus far, apart from simple skills acquired from my prior roles, and building and playing with computers throughout high school. Experimenting with computers, and various software has been a major motivator in opening up my interest into IT. I got married last year in May and I'm excited to be celebrating my first anniversary soon. My hobbies include binging Netflix, computer games and board games; Splendor is one of my favourites. I also enjoy going for nature walks, the picture below was from a vist to Ellenborough Falls. </p>

									<p>I'm <strong>Raymond</strong> (s3853718).I was born and raised in Australia, with my family coming from a Chinese background. I have extended family who live in China and Hong Kong, that I occasionally visit and stay with during vacation periods.  I come primarily from a science background, working in labs doing genetic sequencing and testing. Work that I've done that you might encounter  is a maize product which I worked with, looking to improve yield in unfavourable conditions. While I enjoyed my brief time in this industry, for personal reasons I decided a career change would be for the best and am looking into the IT sector. I've always been curious how things work and as the number of programs/services grows my desire to learn how to create and manipulate them does as well. I have no formal IT experience with my knowledge coming from self-experimentation.  I hope working with Wi-Fives can provide valuable insight and experience in working on an IT project. Apart from IT related projects, during my spare time I like to spend time in the backyard, where over the last few years I have been working on cultivating a garden. I like mostly to keep producing plants: lemons, apricots, mandarin oranges, kaffir, melons and tomatoes are all things I’ve managed to grow.</p>

									<p>Hi, I'm <strong>Matthew</strong> (s3858024). I was born and raised in Brisbane, Australia with a small amount living in South Australia. I'm currently engaged and hoping for our wedding in October 2020. I currently work at the Ronald McDonald House in a supportive role called "Family Experience". I have a passion for helping people and been involved with many volunteering roles throughout my life helping the community. Before my current job, I worked in a Data Centre administration role. This has given me my passion for IT and wanting to learn more about the tech world. I believe the future is IT and we must all adapt for what is coming. I'm looking forward to exploring emerging IT field ideas with my peers in our team Wi-Fives. It's great we can all come together and make something great and share a common passion.</p>

								<p>Allowing everyone in the group to review and collate the results of each individuals test is imperative to ensure from the team's inception that we work effectively.</p>
								<p>If we look at the Learning Style test results, it shows the majority of the group have a visual approach; this would indicate that we would see a greater improvement of understanding when communicating in a visual context such as pictures or utilising chat records to refer back to info. However, in contrast to Chris, Kodyn and Matthew, Raymond utilised a different Learning Style test where it shows signs of potential difficulty in scheduling a consistent time to study or learn; this could pose a high degree of risk in coordinating information in a group assessment.</p>
								<p>The behavioural tests are highly beneficial to understand in a group assessment context; this is because it provides everyone with significant insight into how someone might respond or act in a situation. Raymond and Chris showed similar results in the test, where they are primarily are driven on their inventiveness and creativity, but this also extends to their vigorous intellect and unique perspective. In contrast to Kodyn and Matthew, where they achieved similar behaviour results as well, but with some differences as well, they both are tailored to be leaders. The risk in the assessment primarily stems from having two strong leadership types; however, if we look deeper it shows Kodyn has a ruthless level of rationality, but when assessing Matthew's leadership behaviours it shows a stark contrast where he inspires others to achieve and perform well. Fundamentally both leadership types could complement each other in their weaknesses but still have the possibility to clash over the direction.</p>
								<p>Overall we have to be careful when delivering an open conversation and ensuring differing perspectives are taken into account, whether or not they sound rationale, for example. The team will need to primarily focus on a visual communication type to support the majority of the team and maintain as much contact with members that have limited availability.</p>

						<p>Across the board, team members have chosen positions all relating to the IT industry. More specifically, these jobs correlating to each other by use of programming or various interactions with industry-standard IT software.</p>
						<p>Placing our first focus on Chris, Raymond and Kodyn where their jobs have many similarities in terms of skill-set, but also includes some differences. Chris' ideal occupation is to be an Android Programmer, which involves the development of software and understanding. of programming languages. Similarly to this, Raymond wanting to be a Games Developer and Kodyn looking to be a Senior Front-end Engineer involved the same skill-set. Cohesive teamwork and collaboration in groups are essential for these occupations as they target multi-faceted projects which for example, in Raymond's case is looking at working with game designers and artists to create mobile gaming applications effectively.</p>
						<p>Leading into Matthew's ideal job, he has a different ideal job in the form of a Data Administrator. Similarities are still made to Kodyn and Chris' ideal jobs, particularly in the area of security. Matthew's primary focus is maintaining a database via ensuring its integrity and security; this is subtly different for Kodyn and Chris' where security is maintained with the code implementation to ensure vulnerabilities such as SQL injection does not occur to a database due to a non-sanitised user field.</p>
						<p>Kodyn's ideal occupation has some stark contrasts to all group members chosen positions. Choosing an area of seniority involves a lot more responsibility and more considerable skill-set across many different systems; this could include skills that may involve the management of a team, which may not be present in a more entry-level position.</p>
						<p>Chris and Raymond do have many similarities, but as we can see in Chris' case that his ideal position is explicitly tailored to the Android platform tailoring his focus of what he needs to learn as a skill-set; contrasting with Raymond where he will require a much broader range of programming skills with his scope ranging from various platforms as well as languages.</p>
						<p>If we take a broad approach in comparison of all team members, we can see that Kodyn, Chris and Raymond have a broad scope of skill-sets and involvement with various systems and software; however, with Matthew, we can see more specific tailoring of required skills in their roles from maintaining integrity and security to database administration.</p>
						<p>We see a majority of our team leaning towards substantial programming roles, but have more specialised occupations as well.</p>

								<h3>Question 1</h3>
								<blockquote>How well did your group work together in Assignment 2?</blockquote>
								<p>As discussed in Assessment 2's group reflection, we had many difficulties that were eventually overcome; this represented the group's highs and lows.</p>
								<p>Precisely the teams' consensus had an overwhelming frustration with the unreliability of communication across the board, and this was compounded with suddenly missing or member discontinuing the course.</p>
								<p>The initiative shown by the remaining members, particularly Raymond and Chris by keeping the team on track as well as attempting to follow-up with missing team members had a fundamental impact with the overall successful completion of the assessment.</p>
								<h3>Question 2</h3>
								<blockquote>Will you be introducing any changes in process for Assignment 3?</blockquote>
								<p>The team is going to continue with the same process that was used in the previous assessment; this was accomplished by concise text communication and when necessary a team meeting to ensure consistency of understanding between all members.</p>
								<p>
									In the previous assessment, as mentioned in the previous question discussed the primary detriment to our overall team coordination was initially communication and missing members, which had been resolved towards the end of assessment 2.</p>
